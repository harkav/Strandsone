Welcome to strompris's documentation!
=====================================
   strompris is a webapp developed as an assignment in a course called 
   Problemsolving with high-level languages. 
   It utilizes libraries such as sphinx, fastapi and pandas to create 
   a webapp that displays the prices for electricity for different parts 
   of Norway over time by using data collected from the hvakosterstr√∏mmen api. 
   The two main modules are strompris.py which collects the data and app.py 
   that creates a webserver and displays the chart.
